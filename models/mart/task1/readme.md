## mart_unified_accounts

The Unified Account Model consolidates account lifecycle events and transactional data into a single, cohesive view of each account. It ensures that each account is represented only once, with a summary of its lifecycle events and transactional data. Special attention is given to avoid duplicating transactions in cases where an account has multiple closure events without being reopened.
